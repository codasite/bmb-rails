# Infinite Scroll Implementation - Completed

## What Was Done
Implemented infinite scroll for the bracket board page to improve performance and user experience by loading brackets on-demand instead of loading all brackets at once.

## Why This Was Implemented
- **Performance**: Loading all brackets at once (`posts_per_page => -1`) was slow for large datasets
- **User Experience**: Infinite scroll provides smooth browsing without pagination clicks
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate code between API and template rendering
- **Maintainability**: Centralized query logic and rendering in shared services

## Files Modified

### New Backend Files
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Infrastructure/BracketQueryBuilder.php` - Centralized bracket query building logic
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/BracketListRenderer.php` - Shared rendering logic for bracket lists
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Domain/BracketQueryTypes.php` - Shared types and constants
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/Html/BracketListHtmlApi.php` - HTML fragment endpoint for infinite scroll

### Updated Backend Files
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/Html/BracketHtmlApi.php` - Refactored to use shared services
- `plugin/Public/Partials/shared/BracketsCommon.php` - Refactored to use shared services
- `plugin/Includes/Repository/BracketRepo.php` - Added pagination support
- `plugin/Public/Partials/BracketBoard/BracketBoardPage.php` - Added React component container

### New Frontend Files
- `plugin/Includes/react-bracket-builder/src/brackets/shared/api/BracketListApi.ts` - API class for fetching HTML fragments
- `plugin/Includes/react-bracket-builder/src/components/BracketList/InfiniteScrollBracketList.tsx` - React component for infinite scroll

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes
1. **Created Shared Services** to eliminate code duplication:
   - `BracketQueryBuilder` - Handles all bracket query logic
   - `BracketListRenderer` - Manages bracket list HTML rendering
   - `BracketQueryTypes` - Defines shared types and constants

2. **Added HTML Fragment Endpoint** for infinite scroll:
   - Returns rendered HTML fragments instead of JSON
   - Includes pagination metadata
   - Uses shared query builder and renderer

3. **Updated Repository** to support pagination:
   - Added page and per_page parameters
   - Returns total count for pagination

### Frontend Changes
1. **Created BracketListApi** following existing API patterns:
   - Handles HTML fragment requests
   - Manages pagination parameters
   - Uses existing `WpHttpClient` for authentication

2. **Added React Infinite Scroll Component**:
   - Detects scroll position to trigger loading
   - Fetches and appends HTML fragments
   - Maintains existing filter functionality
   - Preserves all existing bracket interactions

3. **Updated Bracket Board Page**:
   - Replaced static bracket list with React component
   - Maintained existing filter buttons and layout

## Key Benefits Achieved
- **Performance**: Brackets load on-demand, reducing initial page load time
- **Scalability**: Handles large numbers of brackets efficiently
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate code between API and templates
- **Maintainability**: Centralized query and rendering logic
- **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling without pagination breaks
- **Compatibility**: Preserved all existing functionality and React components

## Future Improvements Needed

### Dynamic Click Handler Management
Click handlers for modals and interactive elements are not attached to newly loaded bracket items because they're only attached on initial mount.

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Create Click Delegation Component**
- Support for multiple button classes and their handlers
- Support for async handlers for data loading
- Support for error handling
- Support for state management through props

2. **Required Changes**

React Components:
- `InfiniteScrollBracketList.tsx`: Wrap content with ClickDelegation
- `TournamentModals.tsx`: Remove `#wpbb-tournaments-modals` div, integrate with ClickDelegation
- Remove `addClickHandlers` from all modal components
- Update modal components to work with ClickDelegation:
  - MoreOptionsModal, ShareBracketModal, EditBracketModal, DeleteBracketModal
  - PublishBracketModal, LockLiveTournamentModal, SetTournamentFeeModal
  - EnableUpcomingNotificationModal, DisableUpcomingNotificationModal
  - CompleteRoundModal, UpcomingNotificationRegisterModal

PHP Templates:
- Remove modal containers from:
  - `BracketBoardPage.php`: `#wpbb-public-bracket-modals`
  - `CelebrityBracketsPage.php`: `#wpbb-public-bracket-modals`
  - `OfficialBracketsPage.php`: `#wpbb-public-bracket-modals`
  - `TournamentsPage.php`: `#wpbb-tournaments-modals`
- Wrap bracket list sections with ClickDelegation
- Preserve all button data attributes and classes
- Maintain existing permission checks in PHP templates

3. **Implementation Steps**
1. Create ClickDelegation component with support for:
   - Multiple button classes
   - Async handlers for data loading
   - Error handling for failed operations
   - State management through props
2. Update InfiniteScrollBracketList to use ClickDelegation
3. Remove modal container divs from PHP templates
4. Update modal components to:
   - Remove addClickHandlers
   - Register handlers with ClickDelegation
   - Handle async operations properly
   - Maintain existing state management

4. **Edge Cases to Handle**
- Modals with async data loading (SetTournamentFee, Notifications)
- Modals with conditional logic (PublishBracket)
- Modals that trigger page reloads
- Modals with shared state (bracketData)
- Modals with loading states and error handling
- Modals with multiple button types (MoreOptions)
- Modals that need to preserve state between renders
- Data attribute preservation
- Multiple modal container locations
- Button generation from PHP templates

5. **Button Classes to Support**
- `wpbb-more-options-button`
- `wpbb-share-bracket-button`
- `wpbb-edit-bracket-button`
- `wpbb-delete-bracket-button`
- `wpbb-publish-bracket-button`
- `wpbb-lock-tournament-button`
- `wpbb-set-tournament-fee-button`
- `wpbb-enable-upcoming-notification-button`
- `wpbb-disable-upcoming-notification-button`
- `wpbb-complete-round-btn`
