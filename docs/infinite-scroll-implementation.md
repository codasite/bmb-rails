# Infinite Scroll Implementation - Completed

## What Was Done
Implemented infinite scroll for the bracket board page to improve performance and user experience by loading brackets on-demand instead of loading all brackets at once.

## Why This Was Implemented
- **Performance**: Loading all brackets at once (`posts_per_page => -1`) was slow for large datasets
- **User Experience**: Infinite scroll provides smooth browsing without pagination clicks
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate code between API and template rendering
- **Maintainability**: Centralized query logic and rendering in shared services

## Files Modified

### New Backend Files
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Infrastructure/BracketQueryBuilder.php` - Centralized bracket query building logic
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/BracketListRenderer.php` - Shared rendering logic for bracket lists
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Domain/BracketQueryTypes.php` - Shared types and constants
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/Html/BracketListHtmlApi.php` - HTML fragment endpoint for infinite scroll

### Updated Backend Files
- `plugin/Features/Bracket/Presentation/Html/BracketHtmlApi.php` - Refactored to use shared services
- `plugin/Public/Partials/shared/BracketsCommon.php` - Refactored to use shared services
- `plugin/Includes/Repository/BracketRepo.php` - Added pagination support
- `plugin/Public/Partials/BracketBoard/BracketBoardPage.php` - Added React component container

### New Frontend Files
- `plugin/Includes/react-bracket-builder/src/brackets/shared/api/BracketListApi.ts` - API class for fetching HTML fragments
- `plugin/Includes/react-bracket-builder/src/components/BracketList/InfiniteScrollBracketList.tsx` - React component for infinite scroll

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes
1. **Created Shared Services** to eliminate code duplication:
   - `BracketQueryBuilder` - Handles all bracket query logic
   - `BracketListRenderer` - Manages bracket list HTML rendering
   - `BracketQueryTypes` - Defines shared types and constants

2. **Added HTML Fragment Endpoint** for infinite scroll:
   - Returns rendered HTML fragments instead of JSON
   - Includes pagination metadata
   - Uses shared query builder and renderer

3. **Updated Repository** to support pagination:
   - Added page and per_page parameters
   - Returns total count for pagination

### Frontend Changes
1. **Created BracketListApi** following existing API patterns:
   - Handles HTML fragment requests
   - Manages pagination parameters
   - Uses existing `WpHttpClient` for authentication

2. **Added React Infinite Scroll Component**:
   - Detects scroll position to trigger loading
   - Fetches and appends HTML fragments
   - Maintains existing filter functionality
   - Preserves all existing bracket interactions

3. **Updated Bracket Board Page**:
   - Replaced static bracket list with React component
   - Maintained existing filter buttons and layout

## Key Benefits Achieved
- **Performance**: Brackets load on-demand, reducing initial page load time
- **Scalability**: Handles large numbers of brackets efficiently
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate code between API and templates
- **Maintainability**: Centralized query and rendering logic
- **User Experience**: Smooth scrolling without pagination breaks
- **Compatibility**: Preserved all existing functionality and React components
